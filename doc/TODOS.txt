 <conan_> qmx  roger600_  csadilek  says a combination of powermock and gwtmockito will get you there.
 <conan_> and that there are some tests in existing codebase for this.
 <conan_> csadilek  mbarkley  do you have any links?
 <porcelli> i did something time ago.. and worked nice; ended changing a bit my approach so it didn't enter in our codebase
 <porcelli> with powermocj and gwtmockito
 <conan_> porcelli  got a link?
 <conan_> qmx  roger600_  also search powermockito
 <csadilek> np, they need to mock some static stuff in lienzo which they canâ€™t change, so powermockito should help them. //qmx roger600_ mbarkley
